# Subnational Energy Indicator Mapping

This repository contains a reproducible Python script for visualizing
subnational variation in energy-related indicators using publicly available
tabular and geospatial data.

The code integrates country-level energy indicators with administrative
boundary data at multiple spatial levels and generates side-by-side thematic
maps to facilitate within-country comparison. Indicators are visualized using
a median-centered color scale to emphasize relative spatial disparities rather
than absolute magnitudes.
